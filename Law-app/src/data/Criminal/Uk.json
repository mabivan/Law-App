  "case_name": "The State v. Copeland, Scott, and Howell",
  "citation": "S20A0820, S20A0821, S20A0822",
  "court": "Supreme Court of Georgia",
  "judge": "Justice Bethel",
  "facts": "Three deputies (Copeland, Scott, Howell) used TASERs and physical force against Eurie Lee Martin during an encounter, resulting in his death. The trial court granted them immunity under Georgia's self-defense law, but the Supreme Court vacated the ruling.",
  "Legal_Principle": "Immunity under OCGA ยง 16-3-24.2 requires proof that force was reasonably necessary for self-defense. Deadly force must be justified by imminent threat of death/great bodily harm. Police-citizen encounters must be properly classified (consensual, investigatory, or arrest) before assessing self-defense claims.",
